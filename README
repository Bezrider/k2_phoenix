The Kiss II Portal Engine is the part of the Stargate Portal that does the actual work...
All unnecessary code (frills and mods) have been removed to produce a clean, uncluttered portal engine...

The Kiss Engine is fully integrated... it does not simply add a portal page....
All blocks (the basic method of collecting and display additional information used by most portals) can be added to all phpBB and Mod pages...

These blocks can be arranged in any order, on any page by the administrator... 
Each member can further arrange these blocks using Drag & Drop...
Members can also hide or show individual blocks...

The initial block positioning and visibility is set by the administrator on a group basics...
