The Kiss II Portal Engine is the part of the my Stargate Portal that does the actual work.
All unnecessary code (frills and mods) have been removed to produce a clean, uncluttered portal engine...

The Kiss Engine is fully integrated... (unlike all other portals, it is not simply a extra portal page).

All blocks (the basic method of collecting and display additional information used by most portals) can be added to all phpBB and Mod pages...

The initial block positioning and visibility is set by the administrator on a group basics however, each member can further arrange these blocks using Drag & Drop...
Members can also hide or show individual blocks as they desire...
